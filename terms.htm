Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility 
of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, 
and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might

<p>
     <b class='aboutPageBold'>
Copyrighted Content
</b>
<p>
We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to 
be infringing.   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe 
that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Simple Labs LLC also reviews 
claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted or linked to by Simple Labs LLC 
infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be 
removed, or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following 
information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive 
right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been 
infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks or links thereto are covered by a single notification, 
a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the 
subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Simple Labs LLC to locate the 
material on the Simple Labs LLC Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) 
of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the 
material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; 
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the 
complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 
Please be advised that Simple Labs LLC will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Simple 
Labs LLC determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, 
Simple Labs LLC will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the 
materials unlawful.<br><br>

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the 
DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, 
address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury 
that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the 
jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address 
is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Simple Labs LLC may be found, and that you will 
accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic 
signature (for example, typing your full name).<br><br>

Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Simple Labs LLC Services must meet the then-current statutory 
requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details) and should be sent to the agent 
identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, 
be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.<br><br>
